Installation
============

RELATE currently works with Python 2.7. (This is because `dulwich
<https://www.samba.org/~jelmer/dulwich/>`_, a dependency, does not yet support
Python 3.)

Install `bower <http://bower.io/>`_ and its dependencies, as described on its
web page.

(Optional) Make a virtualenv to install to::

    virtualenv --system-site-packages my-relate-env
    source my-relate-env/bin/activate

To install, clone the repository::

    git clone git://github.com/inducer/relate

Enter the relate directory::

    cd relate

Install the dependencies::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Copy (and, optionally, edit) the example configuration::

    cp local_settings.py.example local_settings.py
    vi local_settings.py

Initialize the database::

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser --username=$(whoami)

Retrieve static (JS/CSS) dependencies::

    python manage.py bower install

Run the server::

    python manage.py runserver

Open a browser to http://localhost:8000, sign in (your user name will be the
same as your system user name, or whatever `whoami` returned above) and select
"Set up new course".

Additional setup steps for Docker
---------------------------------

(TODO)

Add to kernel command line, if needed::

    [...] cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1

Change docker config to disallow IP forwarding::

    --ip-forward=false

in :file:`/etc/default/docker.io`.

Long-term maintenance
---------------------

As course content gets updated repeatedly, more and more little files get
created in the directories containing the course directories. Given enough
time, RELATE may eventually encounter this `issue in dulwich
<https://github.com/jelmer/dulwich/issues/281>`_, the software component that
RELATE uses to access git repositories. If it does, it will fail with
``IOError: [Errno 24] Too many open files``.

To prevent this from happening, it is advisable to occasionally run ``git repack -a -d``
on RELATE's git repositories. This may be accomplished by creating a
`Cron <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>`_ job running
a customized version of
`this script <https://github.com/inducer/relate/blob/master/repack-repositories.sh>`_.
This is needed about once every few hundred course update cycles, so relatively
infrequently.

How to translate RELATE
-----------------------

RELATE is translatable into languages other than English. Run the
following command::

    django-admin makemessages -l de

This will generate a message file for German, where the locale name ``de`` 
stands for Germany. The message file located in the ``locale`` directory
of your RELATE installation. For example, the above command will generate
a message file ``django.po`` in ``/project/root/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES``.

Edit ``django.po``. For each ``msgid`` string, put it's translation in
``msgstr`` right below. ``msgctxt`` strings, along with the commented
``Translators:`` strings above some ``msgid`` strings, are used to provide
more information for better understanding of the text to be translated.
A Simplified Chinese version (demo) of translation is included for Chinese
users, with locale name ``zh-CN``.


When translations are done, run the following command in root directory::

    django-admin compilemessages -l de

Your translations are ready for use. If you translate RELATE, please submit
your translations for inclusion into the RELATE itself.

To enable the translations, open your ``local_settings.py``, uncomment the
``LANGUAGE_CODE`` string and change 'en-us' to the locale name of your
language. 

For more instructions, please refer to `Localization: how to create
language files <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#localization-how-to-create-language-files>`_.
