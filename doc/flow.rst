Flows
=====

.. currentmodule:: course.constants

All interactive content in RELATE is part of a *flow*. Relate uses the made-up
word "flow" to denote an interactive experience that can be any of the
following:

* A quiz
* A few pages of introductory text, combined with some videos
* An exam
* A long-form homework assignment

And possibly many more different things. Technically, a flow consists of
multiple webpages, each of which may allow the participant some type of
interaction, such as submitting answers to questions. All interactions of the
participant with a flow constitute a session. A participant may have multiple
sessions per flow, corresponding to, for example, being able to take the same
quiz multiple times.

This chapter describes how flows are defined from the instructor's perspective.
This consists of two main parts. The first part is defining the interactions
themselves, by providing content for the flow pages. The second consists of
describing what participants are allowed to do, and what grades they are to
receive for their interactions. The system allows tremendous latitude in
defining these rules.

Things that can be decided by flow rules include the following:

* Is student allowed only one or multiple sessions?
* Is the student allowed to review past sessions?
* What are the deadlines involved and how much credit is received for completing a flow?
* Is a participant shown the correct answer and/or the correctness of their
  answer? When are they shown this information? (Right after they submit their
  answer or only after the deadline passes or perhaps right after they have
  submitted their work for grading?)

Overall Structure of a Flow
---------------------------

When described in YAML, a flow has the following components:

.. class:: Flow

    .. attribute:: title

        A plain-text title of the flow

    .. attribute:: description

        A description in :ref:`markup` shown on the start page of the flow.

    .. attribute:: completion_text

        (Optional) Some text in :ref:`markup` shown once a student has
        completed the flow.

    .. attribute:: rules

        (Optional) Some rules governing students' use and grading of the flow.
        See :ref:`flow-rules`.

    .. attribute:: groups

        A list of :class:`FlowPageGroup`.  Exactly one of
        :attr:`groups` or :class:`pages` must be given.

    .. attribute:: pages

        A list of :ref:`pages <flow-page>`. If you specify this, a single
        :class:`FlowPageGroup` will be implicitly created. Exactly one of
        :attr:`groups` or :class:`pages` must be given.

An Example
^^^^^^^^^^

Here's a commented example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    rules:
        # Rules that govern when a new session may be started and whether
        # existing sessions may be listed.

        start:
        -
            # Members of the listed roles may start a new session of this
            # flow if they have fewer than 2 existing sessions if the current
            # time is before the event 'end_week 1'.

            if_before: end_week 1
            if_has_role: [student, ta, instructor]
            if_has_fewer_sessions_than: 2
            may_start_new_session: True
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        -
            # Otherwise, no new sessions will be allowed,
            # but existing ones may be listed.

            may_start_new_session: False
            may_list_existing_sessions: True

        # Rules that govern what a user may do with an existing session.
        access:
        -
             # Before the event 'end_week 2', a user may view, submit answers
             # to the flow, and see the grade they received for their answers.

             if_before: end_week 2
             permissions: [view, modify, see_correctness]

        -
             # Afterwards, they will also be allowed to see the correct answer.
             permissions: [view, modify, see_correctness, see_answer_after_submission]

        # Rules that govern how (permanent) grades are generated from the
        # results of a flow.

        # Grades for this flow are recorded under grade identifier 'la_quiz'.
        # Multiple such grades (if present) are aggregated by taking their maximum.

        grade_identifier: la_quiz
        grade_aggregation_strategy: max_grade

        grading:
        -
            # If the user completes the flow before the event 'end_week 1', they
            # receive full credit.

            if_completed_before: end_week 1
            credit_percent: 100

        -
            # Otherwise, no credit is given.

        whose conditions apply determines the access.

    .. rubric:: Grading-Related

    .. attribute:: grade_identifier

        (Required) The identifier of the grade to be generated once the
        participant completes the flow.  If ``null``, no grade is generated.

        recognize based on IP ranges).

    .. attribute:: if_has_tag

        (Optional) Rule applies if session has this tag (see :attr:`FlowStartRules.tag_session`),
        an identifier.

    .. attribute:: if_in_progress

        (Optional) A Boolean (True/False) value. Rule applies if the session's
        in-progress status matches this Boolean value.

    .. attribute:: if_completed_before

        (Optional) A :ref:`datespec <datespec>`. Rule applies if the session was completed before
        this time.

    .. attribute:: if_expiration_mode

        box at the top of the page if this rule applies.

.. _flow-permissions:

Access permission bits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autoclass:: flow_permission

Determining how final (overall) grades of flows are computed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: FlowGradingRules

    Rules that govern how (permanent) grades are generated from the
    results of a flow.

    Found in the ``grading`` attribute of :class:`FlowRules`.

    .. rubric:: Conditions

    .. attribute:: if_has_role

        (Optional) A list of a subset of ``[unenrolled, ta, student, instructor]``.

    .. attribute:: if_has_tag

        (Optional) Rule applies if session has this tag (see :attr:`FlowStartRules.tag_session`),
        an identifier.

    .. attribute:: if_completed_before

        (Optional) A :ref:`datespec <datespec>`. Rule applies if the session was completed before
        this time.

    .. rubric:: Rules specified

    .. attribute:: credit_percent

        (Optional) A number indicating the percentage of credit assigned for this flow.
        Defaults to 100 if not present.

    .. attribute:: due

        A :ref:`datespec <datespec>` indicating the due date of the flow. This is shown to the
        participant and also used to batch-expire 'past-due' flows.

    .. attribute:: generates_grade

        (Optional) A Boolean indicating whether a grade will be recorded when this
        flow is ended. Note that the value of this rule must never change over
        the lifetime of a flow. I.e. a flow that, at some point during its lifetime,
        *may* have been set to generate a grade must *always* be set to generate
        a grade. Defaults to ``true``.

    .. attribute:: use_last_activity_as_completion_time

        (Optional) A Boolean indicating whether the last time a participant made
        a change to their flow should be used as the completion time.

        Defaults to ``false`` to match past behavior. ``true`` is probably the more
        sensible value for this.

    .. attribute:: description

        (Optional) A description of this set of grading rules being applied to the flow.
        Shown to the participant on the flow start page.

.. autoclass:: grade_aggregation_strategy

.. _flow-page:

Flow pages
----------

.. _flow-groups:

Grouping
^^^^^^^^

Each flow consists of a number of page groups, each of which is made up of
individual :ref:`flow-page`.

The purpose of page groups is to allow shuffling and random selection of
some subset of pages. For example, this functionality would allow you to
have a flow consisting of:

* a fixed introduction page (that is always at the beginning)

* a group of exam questions randomly selected from a bigger pool

* a fixed final page (that may ask the student to, say, affirm academic
  honesty)

Each of these would be a separate 'group'.

Each group allows the following attributes:

.. class:: FlowPageGroup

    .. attribute:: id

        (Required) A symbolic name for the page group.

    .. attribute:: pages

        (Required) A list of :ref:`flow-page`

    .. attribute:: shuffle

        (Optional) A boolean (True/False) indicating whether the order
        of pages should be as in the list :attr:`FlowGroup.pages` or
        determined by random shuffling

    .. attribute:: max_page_count

        (Optional) An integer limiting the page count of this group
        to a certain value. Allows selection of a random subset by combining
        with :attr:`FlowGroup.shuffle`.

.. _page-permissions:

Per-page permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The granted access permissions for the entire flow (see
:class:`FlowAccessRules`) can be modified on a per-page basis.  This happens in
the ``access_rules`` sub-block of each page,
e.g. in :attr:`course.page.ChoiceQuestion.access_rules`:

.. class:: PageAccessRules

    .. attribute:: add_permissions

        A list of :class:`flow_permission` values that are granted *in addition* to
        the globally granted ones.

    .. attribute:: remove_permissions
        A list of :class:`flow_permission` values that are not granted for this page
        even if they are granted by the global flow permissions.

For example, to grant permission to revise an answer on a
:class:`course.page.PythonCodeQuestion`, one might type::

    type: PythonCodeQuestion
    id: addition
    access_rules:
        add_permissions:
            - change_answer
    value: 1

Predefined Page Types
---------------------

.. currentmodule:: course.page

The following page types are predefined:

* :class:`Page` -- a page of static text
* :class:`TextQuestion` -- a page allowing a textual answer
* :class:`SurveyTextQuestion` -- a page allowing an ungraded textual answer
* :class:`HumanGradedTextQuestion` -- a page allowing an textual answer graded by a human
* :class:`InlineMultiQuestion` -- a page allowing answers to be given in-line of a block of text
* :class:`ChoiceQuestion` -- a one-of-multiple-choice question
* :class:`MultipleChoiceQuestion` -- a many-of-multiple-choice question
* :class:`SurveyChoiceQuestion` -- a page allowing an ungraded multiple-choice answer
* :class:`PythonCodeQuestion` -- an autograded code question
* :class:`PythonCodeQuestionWithHumanTextFeedback`
  -- a code question with automatic *and* human grading
* :class:`FileUploadQuestion`
  -- a question allowing a file upload and human grading

.. warning::

    If you change the type of a question, you *must* also change its ID.
    Otherwise, RELATE will assume that existing answer data for this
    question applies to the new question type, and will likely get very
    confused, for one because the answer data found will not be of the
    expected type.

.. |id-page-attr| replace::

    A short identifying name, unique within the page group. Alphanumeric
    with dashes and underscores, no spaces.

.. |title-page-attr| replace::

    The page's title, a string. No markup allowed. Optional. If not supplied,
    the first five lines of the page body are searched for a first-level
    Markdown heading (``# My title``) and this heading is used as a title.

.. |access-rules-page-attr| replace::

    Optional. See :ref:`page-permissions`.

.. |value-page-attr| replace::

    An integer or a floating point number, representing the
    point value of the question.

.. |text-widget-page-attr| replace::

    Optional.
    One of ``text_input`` (default), ``textarea``, ``editor:yaml``,
    ``editor:markdown``.
