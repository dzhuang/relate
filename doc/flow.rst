When described in YAML,
a flow has the following components:

.. class:: Flow

    .. attribute:: title

        A plain-text title of the flow

    .. attribute:: description

        A description in :ref:`markup` shown on the start page of the flow.

    .. attribute:: completion_text

        Some text in :ref:`markup` shown once a student has completed the flow.

    .. attribute:: rules

        (Optional) Some rules governing students' use and grading of the flow.
        See :ref:`flow-rules`.

    .. attribute:: groups

        A list of :class:`PageGroup`

Pages (the units making up a flow) come in groups. Each group has the
following attributes:

.. class:: PageGroup

    .. attribute:: id

        An identifier for this group of pages.

    .. attribute:: pages

        A list of :ref:`pages <flow-page>`

          # flow if they have fewer than 2 existing sessions if the current
          # time is before the event 'end_week 1'.

        -
          # Otherwise, no new sessions will be allowed,
          # but existing ones may be listed.

         -

           # to the flow, and see the grade they received for their answers.

           if_before: end_week 2
           permissions: [view, modify, see_correctness]

          # grade with identifier 'la_quiz' is generated. Multiple such grades
          # (if present) are aggregated by taking their maximum.
